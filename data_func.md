## 1. `static_cast`

- **Syntax**: `static_cast<new_type>(expression)`
- **Use**:
  - `static_cast` is a C++ casting operator used for explicit type conversions.
  - It converts an expression from one type to another, ensuring type safety.
  - Common use cases include converting between related types (e.g., `int` to `double`, pointer types, etc.).
- **Special Note**:
  - Use `static_cast` when you need to perform a well-defined and safe type conversion.
